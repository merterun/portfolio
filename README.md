  <summary>About me</summary>
  
  
  My data science notebooks consist of variety of topics with many different approaches using a lot of different frameworks.

Armed with R, and an array of many powerful libraries, I dive headfirst into the data, exploring its depths to extract valuable insights and transforming complex data into tangible solutions.

Inside these notebooks, you'll find a diverse range of projects that showcase multidimensional skills. From predictive modeling and machine learning to network analysis and exploratory data analysis. Each notebook represents a chapter in my data science story. With a meticulous approach, I carefully select and preprocess the data, construct robust models, and evaluate their performance to ensure reliable and accurate results.

It can also be seen that i'm meticulous in the narrative and document my thought process, observations, explanations and the lessons learned, transforming my notebooks into a repository of knowledge and continuous improvement. 

  
  <summary>Bio</summary>

  
Studied economics at Izmir University of Economics and finished within top 5%. I learned to use tools and topics like R, Sql, regression and time series analysis at University. 
  
In my professional career, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse organizations and esteemed clients representing prominent sectors such as Law, Sports, Technology, and Production. This exposure has fostered my ability to work in a cross-functional capacity and adopted more skills beyond my core knowledge base.

## Projects


> **[Predictive Modeling for Lending Decisions](https://github.com/merterun/credit-risk-evaluation/blob/main/predictive-modeling-for-lending-decisions.ipynb)**

<sub>[REPO](https://github.com/merterun/credit-risk-analysis)</sub>

In this notebook, we look at the evaluation of creditworthiness among bank customers. Through an exploratory data analysis, we gain valuable insights into the dataset and identify significant trends within the variables. Subsequently, i focused on constructing and evaluating models to assess customer creditworthiness. I compared the performance of Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models for classification purposes. At the end i investigated variable importances to determine the key factors influencing creditworthiness.

<sub>[REPO](https://github.com/merterun/fraud-detection-insurance)</sub>

In this project i investigated vehicle insurance claims, differentiating between fraudulent and legitimate ones. The primary objective is to construct a robust model capable of identifying fraudulent claims based on the available data. I employed various techniques including Feature Scaling to ensure optimal data preprocessing, Model Evaluation, and Comparison utilizing '''xgboost''' and '''Random Forest''' algorithms. Furthermore, i employed Hyperparameter Tuning to fine-tune the models for enhanced performance and accuracy.
