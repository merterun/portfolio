# Data Science Portfolio - Mert Ali Er√ºn

Hi there,

This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I conducted for educational purposes, self-learning,  hobby and professional purposes. 

Updated on a regular basis.

<details>
  <summary>About me</summary>
  
  My data science notebooks consist of variety of topics with many different approaches using a lot of different frameworks.

Armed with R, and an array of many powerful libraries, I dive headfirst into the data, exploring its depths to extract valuable insights and transforming complex data into tangible solutions.
  
As a data scientist, I blend technical prowess with a deep understanding of business objectives. I methodically investigate the data, searching for correlations, trends, and anomalies that have the potential to reshape business decisions

Inside these notebooks, you'll find a diverse range of projects that showcase my multidimensional skills. From predictive modeling and machine learning to network analysis and exploratory data analysis. Each notebook represents a chapter in my data science story. With a meticulous approach, I carefully select and preprocess the data, construct robust models, and evaluate their performance to ensure reliable and accurate results.

It can also be seen that i'm meticulous in the narrative and document my thought process, observations, explanations and the lessons learned, transforming my notebooks into a repository of knowledge and continuous improvement. 

  <summary>Bio</summary>

Studied economics at Izmir University of Economics and finished within top 5%. I learned to use tools and topics like R, Sql, regression and time series analysis at University. 
  
In my professional life i was able to work within different organizations and with multiple A+ clients from different sectors such as Law, Sports, Technology and Production, which allowed/pushed me to be cross-functional and adopt new skills outside of my knowledgebase as well.

|**[Predictive Modeling for Lending Decisions](https://github.com/merterun/credit-risk-evaluation/blob/main/predictive-modeling-for-lending-decisions.ipynb)**

[REPO]([REPO](https://github.com/merterun/credit-risk-analysis))

In this notebook, we look at the evaluation of creditworthiness among bank customers. Through an exploratory data analysis, we gain valuable insights into the dataset and identify significant trends within the variables. Subsequently, i focused on constructing and evaluating models to assess customer creditworthiness. I compared the performance of Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models for classification purposes. At the end i investigated variable importances to determine the key factors influencing creditworthiness.|

**[Investigating vehicle insurance Frauds](https://github.com/merterun/fraud-detection-insurance/blob/main/investigating-vehicle-insurance-frauds-with-ml.ipynb)**

[REPO](https://github.com/merterun/fraud-detection-insurance)

In this project i investigated vehicle insurance claims, differentiating between fraudulent and legitimate ones. The primary objective is to construct a robust model capable of identifying fraudulent claims based on the available data. I employed various techniques including Feature Scaling to ensure optimal data preprocessing, Model Evaluation, and Comparison utilizing xgboost and Random Forest algorithms. Furthermore, we employ Hyperparameter Tuning to fine-tune the models for enhanced performance and accuracy.

## Micro Projects
- ### Statistics and Machine Learning
    - [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/genetic-algorithm.ipynb) : In this file, I have implemented simple genetic algorithm that finds out the list of numbers which equal to any specified number when summed together.
    - [Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/Bayesian%20Statistics.ipynb) : In this file, I explored how bayesian statistics works and how prior assumption reflects posterior probabilities using Gun control example. 
    - [Gaussian Mixture Model and Expectation Maximization](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/GMM-EM.ipynb): In this file, I implemented Expectation Maximization algorithm to find out true distribution of one dimensional GMM of 2 gaussians.
    - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb): In this file, I aim to solve linear regression using analytical method and also by implementing gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and minibatch gradient descent algorithms.
