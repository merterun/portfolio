# Data Science Portfolio - Mert Ali Erün

Hi there,

This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I conducted for educational purposes, self-learning,  hobby and professional purposes. 

Updated on a regular basis.

<details>
  <summary>### About me</summary>
  
  My data science notebooks consist of variety of topics with many different approaches using a lot of different frameworks.

Armed with R, and an array of many powerful libraries, I dive headfirst into the data, exploring its depths to extract valuable insights and transforming complex data into tangible solutions.
  
As a data scientist, I blend technical prowess with a deep understanding of business objectives. I methodically investigate the data, searching for correlations, trends, and anomalies that have the potential to reshape business decisions

Inside these notebooks, you'll find a diverse range of projects that showcase my multidimensional skills. From predictive modeling and machine learning to network analysis and exploratory data analysis. Each notebook represents a chapter in my data science story. With a meticulous approach, I carefully select and preprocess the data, construct robust models, and evaluate their performance to ensure reliable and accurate results.

It can also be seen that i'm meticulous in the narrative and document my thought process, observations, explanations and the lessons learned, transforming my notebooks into a repository of knowledge and continuous improvement. 

  <summary>### Bio</summary>

Studied economics at Izmir University of Economics and finished within top 5%. I learned to use tools and topics like R, Sql, regression and time series analysis at University. 
  
In my professional life i was able to work within different organizations and with multiple A+ clients from different sectors such as Law, Sports, Technology and Production, which allowed/pushed me to be cross-functional and adopt new skills outside of my knowledgebase as well.

**[Investigating vehicle insurance Frauds](https://github.com/merterun/fraud-detection-insurance/blob/main/investigating-vehicle-insurance-frauds-with-ml.ipynb)**

[REPO](https://github.com/merterun/fraud-detection-insurance)

In this project i investigated vehicle insurance claims, differentiating between fraudulent and legitimate ones. The primary objective is to construct a robust model capable of identifying fraudulent claims based on the available data. I employed various techniques including Feature Scaling to ensure optimal data preprocessing, Model Evaluation, and Comparison utilizing xgboost and Random Forest algorithms. Furthermore, we employ Hyperparameter Tuning to fine-tune the models for enhanced performance and accuracy.

The objective of this project is to analyze the 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are also done to study user purchase patterns.

A hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and user’s tweets (Content-based filtering).

In this project I have used models such as RNN, LSTM, 1D-CNN to predict the engine failure 50 cycles ahead of its time, and calculated feature importance from them using sensitivity analysis and shap values. Exponential degradation and similarity-based models are also used to calculate its remaining life.

In this project, I have employed regression techniques to estimate the Power curve of an on-shore Wind turbine. Nonlinear trees based regression methods perform best as true power curve is nonlinear. XGBoost is implemented and optimized using GridSearchCV which yields lowest Test RMSE-6.404.

Objective of this project is to identify the in-control data points and eliminate out of control data points to set up distribution parameters for manufacturing process monitoring. I utilized PCA for dimension reduction and Hotelling T2 and m-CUSUM control charts to established mean and variance matrices.

In this project I applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LightGBM to detect consumers who will default the loan. SMOTE is used to combat class imbalance and LightGBM is implemented that resulted into the highest accuracy 98.89% and 0.99 F1 Score.
